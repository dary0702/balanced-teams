# pickup-soccer-game-balanced-teams-sorter
Python project that generates balanced teams for pickup soccer games.

The python script expects a csv as input (example in the repo), with Player name, Rating and a boolean column indicating if said player is participating in the pickup game for which you want to sort the teams.

Currently it is suited to work for a scenario with 4 teams of 5 people, but you can change the code to adapt to your needs with little changes needed.
